Anagram or Proteus Process Training Script

I offer these without any guarantees, as I created them only for my own use and they come as they are. 
Any questions, please pm me on facebook (Markus Pfeil) I am willing to help.

The scripts are to be used with the Pythonista 3 App for iphone/ipad. 
I realize that pythonista is not for free, but I have no free solution to offer. Still it is very reasonably priced for what it offers.

Using goes as follows: 


Install „Pythonista 3“ app. 
In the library section make a folder for your scripts, called proteus, or whatever you like. 

For the English version, use: proteus_en_py.txt, proteus_list_en_py.txt and proteus_en_pyui.txt
For the Anagram only version, use the files: todd_py.txt, todd_list_py.txt and todd_pyui.txt

Email yourself the script files so you can access them via mail on the phone/ipad. 
Open the todd_py.txt attachment and press the "Share button" at the bottom to get the Actions Menu up. There Select "Run Pythonista Script". There select "Import File" 
Go back and do the same for all three files. 

Then open Pythonista and find your files in the Libraries root folder. 
Use "Edit" and select the three files, then move them to your folder using the "move" item on the bottom. 
Go into your folder and rename your files as follows: 
Open the first file (e.g. todd_py.txt) by clicking on it. Next to the file name on the top there is a small triangle, click on that. 
To the right of the name there is a button labelled ...|  click on that. 
You can now change the filename. From todd_py.txt, change it to todd.py. From todd_list_py.txt to todd_list.py. 
From todd_pyui.txt to todd.pyui (this will change the content from text to a Button layout)
For the other files do the same, adjust for the names. The names are important, the scripts will not work otherwise, as the files are referenced by name. 

The reason for this complex bit is simply that for someone not familiar with pythonista importing anything but a .txt file is difficult (or I have not found an easy way)

When you have done this, open todd.py or proteus_en.py and press the "run" triangle on top. 
The script selects a word from the list and you can press buttons to "ask". Press "a" to ask whether there is an "a" in the word. The todd version has only letters to check anagrams. The proteus_en ones also have tags attached to the words. 
Press "moving" to ask whether the thing can move. Press "NOT Alive or Edible" to get a yes for those words that need a yes in Phedons Mind_Peek_complete chart. 
I have not added all "tags", such as "moving", "alive" etc to each word as this is some writing work, but I think it would be very useful, as you can then also practice what 
happens when I do something wrong (i.e. you follow the wrong track in the diagram) and for example ask "Do you have one in your house" when the spectator thinks of a chair, where you should never have to ask this if you follow the chard. 
For the English Chart I did not do that, as it was too much work to be done quickly, and I do not use it (I have a German one). 
If you want to change that sort of stuff, edit the proteus_list_en.py, where there is a word in every line and all the tags attached to it in the "data" field. The "tags" field holds all tags that you can ask. Letters need only to be added to the „tags“ field, not to the „data“ field, as they are already „in“ the words.
later. Currently the english version can do 20 tags, the todd one does not have tags, but all letters. In the todd one, simply add words (with brackets and „“s and so forth if you need more words. All lowercase!
Press reveal to see the word that has been chosen.
To reset, close the view and restart the script. The todd version highlights what you have already pressed for your reference.
